A CASE STUDY ON LEMONADE FINANCE

Lemonade Finance is a provider of digital banking services. Incorporated in 2020 in Canada, Olalera Ridwan and Rian Cockran founded it. This digital banking provider is intended for immigrants living in North America and Europe. The company provides users with a bank account in both their country of residence and country of origin to support their personal & business banking needs, enabling users to undertake money transactions at no fees and market standard exchange rates securely.

Lemonade Finance is a multi-currency platform company specializing in African diaspora financial services. It offers the ability to manage bank accounts in multiple currencies and move money across borders at cheap rates.
Lemonade Finance enabled people living in Africa to send or receive money. Nevertheless, after a few months, the company realized its app was used mainly by Africans abroad. 

Lemonade Finance has raised a total of $1.5M in funding over two rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Nov 1, 2021, from a Pre-Seed round.
Six investors fund lemonade Finance. Y Combinator and Ventures Platform are the most recent investors. The company's investors include Y Combinator, the famed startup accelerator, Microtraction, Ventures Platform, Acuity Venture Partners, and Zrosk.

Nigeria is home to Africa's most valuable fintech companies, like Flutterwave and Paystack. However, while they enable people to receive payments across borders, instant personal remittances are not their focus. Thus, to receive money from the continent, Africa's diaspora used informal methods like getting a friend of a friend that needed the currency they had and was willing to exchange for the local currency, negotiate exchange rates and they did this severally till they were able to get the total amount they need for whatever transaction. This method even ended up being a successful business for some.

In 2020, about 100,000 Nigerian students studied abroad. These students are frequently kept captive by changing laws that make it impossible to obtain school fees, medical aid monies, and pocket money on time. Lemonade Finance sees an opportunity to address this need in the industry. Lemonade Finance offers local and international transfers to African countries like Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Canada, and the UK instantly without any hidden fees and makes international transfers at the official market exchange rate. 

With the app, users can send money across Africa within a few minutes with great exchange rates, even though this kind of International transfer usually takes days and is transferred to local bank accounts and mobile money accounts. 

Lemonade Finance was built on Golang; it uses PostgreSQL for data storage, New Relic for monitoring, and Vue JS for front-end engineering. 
The new-age influential technologies such as digitization, robotic process automation (RPA), interactive back channels, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT),  better consumer experience, blockchain and shared infrastructure are some of the major changes expected in the next five to ten years in financial services.

Major companies in the financial services domain and potential competitors for Lemonade finance include Western Union, WorldRemit, Wise, and PayPal. 
 
 Within the Lemonade app, a user receives a bank account number from a Nigerian naira, Ghanaian cedi, or Kenyan shilling wallet after signing up where a benefactor in Africa can send money, and the user may convert the money received from any African currency to Canadian dollars or British pounds, and then transfer it to their Canadian or British bank account. Alternatively, the user could leave the money on the app in African currency if they want to make subsequent transfers. Furthermore, the money is received within 5 minutes for any transfers made. 

Some core metrics for measuring success in the financial services domain include;
1. Active Clients
2. Applications Launch and Load Time
3. Goal Abandonment Rate
4. Task Completion Rate
5. Application Functionality
6. Net Promoter Score (NPS)
7. Retention Rate
8. New Lead Generation
   
   Lemonade Finance began accepting beta customers in 2020, with transactions from Canada to Nigeria as the first. Lemonade Finance has processed $30,000 from about 100 consumers as of November 2020. Lemonade Finance has already surpassed the $1 million mark while making significant regulatory progress. 

It will be interesting to see lemonade finance offer card services that include issuing cards and processing card payments in the USA, UK and Canada, and African countries. Hence, if anyone in the diaspora goes back home, they can easily access the local currency.
No one has offered this service yet, and it will make them unique; users in North America can go back to Africa and will need access to the local currency, and because of the financial laws and restrictions in these African countries, there might be restrictions but adding this service makes it easier for the users to access cash and the local currency at their location.
They could utilize Python for the back end to create the card number, CVV and expiry date from a database like Oracle and HTML or CSS JavaScript for the front end.
